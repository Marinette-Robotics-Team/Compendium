GitHub
=========

All programming computers will need GitHub Desktop to sync RobotCode with the repository.

GitHub Desktop is a tool for synchronising code with public and private repositiories on the GitHub website.
There are versions available for mac and windows, with official linux support expected soon.

It can be found `here. <https://desktop.github.com/>`_
