Drive Trains
============

This section contains tutorials on how to program some of the more advanced drivetrains. Note that this is a guide for more advanced users.

If you're instead looking for a simple tank drive, see the `Tank Drive subsystem <./../subsystems/examples/tankdrive.html>`_, as well as its `DriveContinuous <./../commands/example/commands/tankdrive.html>`_ and `DriveForwards <./../commands/example/commands/drivesetpoint.html>`_ commands.
